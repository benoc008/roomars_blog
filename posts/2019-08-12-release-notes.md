# Release notes 2019. 08. 12.

With this weeks release many of our features will be available to the participants of the Beta tester programme.
Among visual changes in the static pages, such as get started and documentation, the new object type and room types can now be tested.

___
## New object type
The new object type is the Image type. From now on if you want to upload an image of either a picure, a powerpoint slide or anything, you don't have to create a flat 3D Object for it. Just upload the image, specify the real world size and it will be done automatically for you.

## New room types
The new room types are Mobile and Gallery.
### Mobile
For scenes that are not bound to a spcific room, the new mobile type is more sufficient. If it is an assembly guide, a tabletop presentation or educational material, just use the Mobile room type. After creating the room, you will not need to scan anything, instead guiding lines will help you to align your objects in the 3D editor.

### Gallery
If you want to share your artwork or a slide deck in Augmented Reality the easiest way to do is with the Gallery room type. You don't need to worry about 3D editing and aligning your items. Create the room and add frames in the Gallery editor. You can upload pictures to each frame, and then swipe between them on the app. It's that easy!

We hope you will enjoy this new release!
